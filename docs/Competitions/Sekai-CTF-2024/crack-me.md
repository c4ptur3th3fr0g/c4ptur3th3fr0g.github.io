# Crack me

Reverse engineering an Android app.
It was a React Native application written in JS, and we used jadx to decompile it.
The idea was to modify the JS and put the flag in the error message.
The hard part was to decompile, modify, recompile, and sign the APK.

!!! TODO

    Add some resources on how to use jadx
