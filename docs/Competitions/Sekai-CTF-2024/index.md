# Sekai CTF 2024

{{ create_links(page.meta) }}

This competition had two new categories for us: `blockchain` and `ppc` (Professional Programming & Coding). The latter is like regular competitive programming problems.

There were some tasks we thought but didn't solve.

## Tagless

> the trick was in the error page ðŸ˜¯

## Play to earn

-   [ ] How to run a blockchain task locally?
-   [ ] and in particular how to solve this one?

By the number of solves this looks like a good first task to learn about `blockchain` category.

## Calcql

Use Codeql to extract a function from a python code. The code is generated randomly (see `shuffler.py`). There are several methods `fn_*` that returns an integer by calling other methods. There are several methods `entry_*` that returns an integer by calling other `fn_*` methods. The goal is to find the `entry_*` method that returns the value 42 by sending a query in Codeql.

-   [ ] Learn the basics of Codeql

## Railgun

This was a hard ppc challenge, and we didn't make much progress on it.
