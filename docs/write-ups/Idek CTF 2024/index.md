- rev: Write me
- misc: Minecraft. writeup: [1](https://yun.ng/c/ctf/2024-idek-ctf/misc/minecraft)

- pwn: gambler -- we solved this one, but not properly, learn how to exploit memory vulnerability. [exploit](https://github.com/idekctf/idekctf-2024/blob/main/pwn/lazy-gambler-pwner/debug/solve_without_binja.py).

TO DO:

- [ ] Add category pyjail (Crator from this competition was a "safe" pyjail, the pyjail was not the weakness)

    - https://overpass-turbo.eu/ you can write queries with info from open streem map.
- [ ] Add resources on how to run minecraft client.
    - Launcher (Client): multimc / prism / https://github.com/Diegiwg/PrismLauncher-Cracked
    Prism allows offline mode (I haven't been able to set it up)
